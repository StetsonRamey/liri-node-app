  Philosophy
  ==========
  * frontend - none, this baby is all command line
  * backend -
    * just a javascript file and some node modules
    * and a txt file
    * and some other stuff


  Struggles
  =========
  If I had to do this over again, I would have coded it all differently.  First up, I would have used a `switch(case)` logic instead of all those `if / elseif` statements.  Then stored the logic in functions.  That would make this thing way more nimble for someone else to work on, and it would look a lot cleaner too.

  Biggest struggle was calling things correctly and dealing with the response objects.  When I called twitter and spotify, in the command line it looked like I wasn't getting anything back, and I spent a good couple hours reading and trying to figure out what I was doing wrong with my call.  Turns out the object was coming back correctly and it just diplayed in a way I didn't expect in the terminal.  So that was cool.

  Ideas for Improvement
  =====================
  `switch (case)` and functions all day

  Styling
  =======
  it looks bad ass on iterm 2 with startdust theme.
